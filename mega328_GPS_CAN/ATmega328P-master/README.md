# ATmega328P

Driver library for basic functionalities of the ATmega328P (Arduino UNO)
microcontroller.
 * UART - UART (blocking)
 * UART2 - UART (interrupt based) (uses RING.h)
 * SPI - SPI Master
 * SPI2 - SPI Master (interrupt based)
 * TWI - I2C Master
 * TWI2 - I2C Master (interrupt based)
 * ADC - Analog to digital converter (interrupt based)
 * SERVO - Servo driver (interrupt based)
 * ESC - ESC driver (uses SERVO.h)
 * PID2 - PID controller driver with variable frequency (accessible iterate
 function) (interrupt based)
 * RING - Ring buffer implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project is written in C and nothing except the standard libraries
(avr-libc) are needed.

### Installation

Download this repository and save it somewhere where you can find it later.
Add the repository folder to your include paths and the source files (.c) to
your project when compiling.

#### Atmel Studio 7.0

When you created a new project right-click on the project (in the solution
explorer) and go to Properties->Toolchain->[Your Compiler]->Directories and add
a new directory.
Select this repository in the file chooser and click ok. This lets the compiler
find the header files when you include them in your sources.
You also have to add the needed source files to your project (if you use UART.h
then you also need to add UART.c). You can add them by right-clicking on the
project, go to "Add" and then press "Existing item...".
Now select the source files (.c) and press "Add". (You can also add them as
link so it doesn't always copies the whole file to your project directory by
pressing "Add as link"
which appears when you click the small downwards facing arrow to the right of
the "Add" button in the file chooser)

## Usage

The functions of every module start with the module name in all capitals,
followed by an underline and then the function name in camel case formatting.
E.g.
```
UART_transmitBurst()
```

Most modules have an init function that needs to be called for every other
function to work properly. E.g.
```
UART_init()
```
The functions should all be self explanatory.
Also make sure to enable interrupts before calling any function of modules that
use interrupts.

## Building

In the [test folder](./test/) are very simple examples. They can be built with
the [makefile](./test/makefile) that is also located there. Use `make` or
`make all` builds all examples, or e.g. `make ADC_main.hex` to build the ADC
example. The hex files can be uploaded to an Arduino UNO with e.g.
`make upload_ADC` to flash the ADC example onto the Arduino.

## TODO

 - [ ] Add tests for all modules
 - [ ] Remove useless modules
 - [ ] Add useful documentation
 - [ ] Only include what's needed
 - [ ] Timer macros
 - [x] Split NRF24L01 to own repo
 - [x] Improve makefile
 - [x] UART redirect standard streams on default
 - [x] Organize directories
 - [x] Add makefile
